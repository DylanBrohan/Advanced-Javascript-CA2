\*\*This Project was Inspired by - [Traversy Media](https://github.com/bradtraversy) & His Work on Full Stack Applications It was also inspired by some [Medium Documents](https://medium.com/javascript-in-plain-english/full-stack-mongodb-react-node-js-express-js-in-one-simple-app-6cc8ed6de274)
that helped me in understanding full stack applications.
